    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Solid waste management is essential for maintaining environmental health and sustainability. This project explores the issues of solid waste management and examines solutions implemented by our group at Lovely Professional University (LPU) and similar external initiatives.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="literature-review">
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <h3>Background on Solid Waste Management</h3>
        <p>Solid waste management involves collecting, transporting, and processing waste materials. Common challenges include lack of infrastructure, awareness, and regulatory enforcement. Recent advances emphasize not just disposal but recycling and waste minimization.</p>
        
        <h3>Technological Approaches</h3>
        <p>Key technologies include IoT-enabled smart bins for monitoring waste levels, predictive analytics using machine learning, and automated recycling systems. These advancements improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.</p>

        <h3>Case Studies</h3>
        <p>Examples include cities like San Francisco and Tokyo, where data-driven and community-supported waste management strategies have shown positive outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="materials-methods">
        <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
        <p>This project involved data collection from LPUâ€™s waste management practices and analysis of external studies. Key steps included assessing current methods, integrating new technology, and collaborating with external case studies for best practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="results-discussion">
        <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <h3>Evaluation of Findings</h3>
        <p>Our initiatives at LPU led to optimized waste collection through smart bin systems, resulting in reduced fuel usage and costs. Community engagement also boosted recycling rates on campus.</p>
        
        <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
        <p>Comparisons with global cities highlight potential improvements, such as AI-driven sorting and community programs, that could further enhance waste management at LPU.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The integration of technology in waste management practices at LPU demonstrates significant potential for environmental sustainability and efficiency. Continued focus on community involvement and technological innovation is essential for future success.</p>
